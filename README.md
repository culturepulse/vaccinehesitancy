# vaccinehesitancy
A repository for data from the vaccine hesitancy study done with Kingston University. More information on the paper available here: https://mythos.one/justinlane/b086b3 
# Results overview
In a recent study, we gathered a representative sample of UK residents and asked them about their opinions on the vaccines (note: data was collected before recent news about blood-clotting issues in relation to the AstraZenica vaccine). 
We found that most people will take the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines. 
Overwhelmingly, individuals will not take the Sinovac or Sputnik vaccines. 
People would rather take one of two fictive American vaccines that don’t exist (Medicare or Theranos). 
# Knowledge of the unknowable
Generally, the population was able to identify the two vaccines that do not exist. However, 10-15% of the population stated that they are “knowledgeable” about these vaccines, while 85-90% of the population stated that they have never heard of these vaccines. 
# Effect of religion
We also investigated the relationship between religious leadership and vaccine support. Generally, it was found that all individuals feel that their religious leaders, on average, state support for the vaccine, with there being significantly higher support for those who identify as “spiritual but not religious” in relation to Muslims and Catholics, but not protestants, Anglicans, or others.
